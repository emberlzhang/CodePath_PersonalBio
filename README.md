## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

One minor challenge was encountered in identifying the "Assistant" capability, which was found under Editor tab instead of via the given written instructions.

## App Brainstorming

My top 3-5 favorite applications and 2-3 favorite features include:

Prompt: Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.

One application I would like to build is an intelligent symptom and treatment tracker for chronic illness patients. Powered by natural-language processing, it would enable the easy and intuitive input of daily health log information for patients at the touch of a button, kind of like Siri for health tracking. Different from most health tracking applications, this app would enable seamless translation of audio input and natural sentences like "took the same supplements as I did yesterday" and automatically store that into quantifiable health information to add to the user's health log (e.g. with supplement names, dosages, and timing inferred from these natural sentences), without the need for the user to input dozens of fields or answer detailed prompts. After tracking symptoms and medications for some time, the user would be able to access a longitudial dashboard displaying the timing of their treatments alongside their improving/worsening symptoms, which would enable the patient and their healthcare providers to gain new insights into impact of their medications, supplements, lifestyle changes, and other interventions on their symptoms and key health measures.
